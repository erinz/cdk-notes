- Use AWS Construct Libary, create a simple project with CDK and deploy to AWS.
- Familiar with AWS CodeSuite and how to use if for CI/CD.
- Create CI/CD pipeline of deploying code change to production preview app at AWS within seconds.
- Comprae AWS CDK with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) 

## 3. Determine success
Familiar with building AWS infrastructure resource using CDK, set up a CI/CD pipeline of deploying code change to AWS (code -> preview) within seconds.
